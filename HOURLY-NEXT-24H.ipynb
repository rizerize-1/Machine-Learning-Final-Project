    "\n",
    "This initial section prepares the Python environment by importing all the necessary libraries for the forecasting pipeline and defining a custom function for a key performance metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Core Libraries**: It starts by importing `numpy` for numerical operations and `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis, which are fundamental for handling the weather dataset.\n",
    "*   **Standard Utilities**: Libraries like `warnings` (to suppress unnecessary warnings and keep the output clean), `os` (for interacting with the operating system), and `re` (for regular expressions) are included for general-purpose tasks.\n",
    "*   **Visualization**: `matplotlib` and `seaborn` are imported for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations, which are essential for data exploration and result analysis.\n",
    "*   **Statistical Analysis**: `statsmodels` is used for statistical tests and plotting functions like the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) plot, which is vital for time series analysis. `scipy` is included for scientific and technical computing.\n",
    "*   **Machine Learning Models**: A wide range of regression models are imported from popular libraries:\n",
    "    *   `scikit-learn`: `SGDRegressor`, `RandomForestRegressor`, and `StackingRegressor`.\n",
    "    *   `xgboost`: `XGBRegressor` and `XGBClassifier`, known for their high performance.\n",
    "    *   `lightgbm`: `LGBMRegressor`, another powerful gradient-boosting framework.\n",
    "*   **Model Evaluation & Preprocessing**:\n",
    "    *   From `scikit-learn`, various metrics like `mean_squared_error` and `r2_score` are imported to evaluate model performance. `MinMaxScaler` is used for feature scaling.\n",
    "    *   `TimeSeriesSplit` is specifically included for cross-validation on time series data, which respects the temporal order of observations.\n",
    "*   **Hyperparameter Tuning**: `optuna` is imported for efficient hyperparameter optimization, helping to find the best settings for the models.\n",
    "*   **Model Explainability**: `shap` is included to help explain the output of the machine learning models, providing insights into which features are most important for the predictions.\n",
    "*   **Custom Metric**: A function `rmse` (Root Mean Squared Error) is defined. This is a standard metric for regression tasks that measures the average magnitude of the errors, giving more weight to larger errors."

Other columns like `precip` and `visibility` have a much smaller number of missing entries, which will need to be addressed in the next cleaning stage. Many other columns have no missing data at all."

    "This section focuses on creating new, physically meaningful features from the existing data. The goal is to explicitly represent meteorological concepts and cyclical patterns, making it easier for the machine learning model to understand the underlying physics that drive temperature changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Initial Setup**:\n",
    "    *   The first step is to sort the DataFrame by `datetime` and reset the index. This ensures that the data is in strict chronological order, which is essential for any time-series operations that follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Feature Creation**:\n",
    "    *   **1. Radiation Efficiency**: This feature models how effectively solar radiation penetrates the atmosphere. It combines `solarradiation` and `solarenergy` and adjusts for `cloudcover`, providing a single metric for the \"strength\" of the sun's heating effect.\n",
    "    *   **2. Moisture Ratio**: The `dew_humidity_ratio` is engineered by dividing the dew point by humidity. This provides a measure of air moisture saturation.\n",
    "    *   **3. Wind Vector Components**: The wind direction (`winddir`) and speed (`windspeed`) are decomposed into `wind_u` (east-west) and `wind_v` (north-south) components. This transforms a cyclical feature (direction) into a format that machine learning models can easily use. The components are also \"de-biased\" by subtracting their means to stabilize the model's learning process.\n",
    "    *   **4. Convective Potential (Storminess)**: Two features, `convective_potential` and `storminess`, are created to estimate the potential for convective storms by combining humidity, radiation, and wind data.\n",
    "    *   **5. Seasonality (Annual and Diurnal)**: This part encodes the cyclical nature of time.\n",
    "        *   **Annual Cycle**: The `dayofyear` is extracted and transformed into `doy_sin` and `doy_cos` components to represent the yearly cycle.\n",
    "        *   **Diurnal Cycle**: The `hour` of the day is similarly converted into `hour_sin` and `hour_cos` to represent the 24-hour daily cycle.\n",
    "        *   **Daylight Mask**: A binary feature, `is_daylight`, is created to explicitly tell the model whether it is daytime or nighttime.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Verifying the New Features**:\n",
    "    *   The `df.head(5)` command is called to display the first few rows of the DataFrame. This allows for a quick inspection of the newly created columns (like `radiation_efficiency`, `wind_u`, `hour_sin`, etc.) to ensure they have been calculated and added to the dataset correctly. The output shows the DataFrame has expanded to 31 columns."

    "*   **1. Physics-Based Base Features**:\n",
    "    *   This part re-implements the core physics-based features from the previous section. This ensures all necessary base features are present before creating more complex ones that depend on them. It includes the calculation of `radiation_efficiency`, `dew_humidity_ratio`, wind vectors (`wind_u`, `wind_v`), `convective_potential`, `storminess`, and seasonality (`doy_sin`, `hour_sin`, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **2. Rolling / Lag Features (Windows: 24h, 168h, 336h)**:\n",
    "    *   This is a classic time series technique where statistics are calculated over a moving \"window\" of past data. It allows the model to see recent history and trends.\n",
    "    *   **Rolling Wind Statistics**: The code calculates the `mean` and `variance` of the `wind_u` and `wind_v` components over 168-hour (7-day) and 336-hour (14-day) windows. This provides the model with insights into the prevailing wind patterns and their stability over the past one to two weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **3. Pressure & Humidity Gradients**:\n",
    "    *   Gradients measure the rate of change of a variable, which is a powerful predictor in time series forecasting.\n",
    "    *   **Hourly Changes**: The code uses `.diff(1)` to calculate the change in `sealevelpressure`, `humidity`, and `dew` point from the previous hour. A rapid drop in pressure, for example, can be a strong indicator of an impending storm.\n",
    "    *   **Rolling Statistics on Gradients**: It then calculates the `mean` and `variance` of pressure and humidity over 24-hour and 168-hour windows to capture the average trend and volatility of these key meteorological variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **4. Climate & Regime Indicators**:\n",
    "    *   These features are designed to capture the broader climate context beyond just the immediate weather.\n",
    "    *   **Seasonal Indicators**: `is_wet_season` is a binary flag based on the month, and `season_progress` indicates how far into the wet/dry season the current date is.\n",
    "    *   **Soil Moisture**: `soil_wetness_index` is a sophisticated feature that models moisture retention in the ground. It calculates the total rainfall over the past 14 days (336 hours) and uses a negative exponential function to estimate soil saturation. Wetter soil can significantly impact local temperature and humidity.\n",
    "    *   **Monsoon Logic**: Based on the direction of the north-south wind (`wind_v`), the code creates flags to identify the Southwest (`sw_monsoon_flag`) and Northeast (`ne_monsoon_flag`) monsoon periods, which are dominant climate drivers in the region.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **5. Rain Type Classification**:\n",
    "    *   This part aims to classify precipitation type using the available data, creating more nuanced rain features.\n",
    "    *   **Rain Ratios**: Features like `precip_cloud_ratio` and `precip_efficiency` are engineered to characterize the nature of the rainfall (e.g., light rain from heavy clouds vs. heavy rain with low humidity).\n",
    "    *   **Convective vs. Stratiform Rain**: A rule-based system is implemented to classify rain as either `is_convective_rain` (intense, stormy rain) or `is_stratiform_rain` (steady, less intense rain). This is based on whether precipitation, wind gust, and humidity are above their median values.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **6. Advanced Physical Coherence Features**:\n",
    "    *   These features capture the dynamic interplay between different weather variables over time.\n",

    "This section applies Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) smoothing to a selection of key features. This is a sophisticated time-series technique used to create smoothed versions of features that capture underlying trends while reducing short-term noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   *Feature Selection*: A specific list of important numerical features (ewma_features) is defined, including humidity, dew, solarradiation, sealevelpressure, windspeed, and precip. These are core meteorological variables that are likely to have meaningful trends over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   *Configuration of Smoothing Levels*: A dictionary named ewma_configs is created to define three different smoothing levels, each with a different \"memory\":\n",
    "    *   *Short Memory (72h)*: An alpha of 0.10 gives more weight to recent data, creating a smoothed feature that closely tracks recent changes over approximately the last 3 days.\n",
    "    *   *Medium Memory (168h)*: An alpha of 0.05 provides a more balanced view, smoothing the data over roughly the past week (7 days).\n",
    "    *   *Long Memory (336h)*: An alpha of 0.02 gives more weight to older data, capturing the long-term trend over approximately the last 14 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   *Application of EWMA*: The code iterates through each selected feature and applies each of the three EWMA configurations to it.\n",
    "    *   For each combination, it calculates the exponentially weighted moving average using the .ewm() method in pandas. The adjust=False argument is used to ensure that the weights are calculated recursively, giving more emphasis to recent observations in a consistent manner.\n",
    "    *   This process generates 18 new features in total (6 original features × 3 smoothing levels). Each new feature is named descriptively, such as humidity_ewma_72h, making it clear which feature and which smoothing window it represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   *Purpose and Benefit*: Unlike a simple moving average that weighs all past points equally, an EWMA gives exponentially more weight to recent data points. This makes it more responsive to recent changes while still providing a smoothed trend. By creating features with short, medium, and long-term memories, the model is given a multi-scale view of the trends in the data, which can significantly improve its predictive power. The \"Leakage-Safe\" comment in the code indicates that this operation is performed without using future information, making it safe for training a forecasting model."

    "This section establishes the performance benchmarks that the machine learning models must exceed. It defines two simple, common-sense baseline models—Persistence and Climatology—and calculates their Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for each of the five forecast horizons.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **1. Defining Baseline Models**:\n",
    "    *   **Persistence Model**: This model follows the simple heuristic: \"the weather tomorrow will be the same as the weather today.\" For a forecast horizon of `h` hours, it naively assumes the temperature at `t+h` will be the same as the temperature at `t`. In this implementation, it uses the current hour's temperature (`test['temp']`) as the prediction for all future horizons.\n",
    "    *   **Climatology Model**: This model predicts the temperature based on the long-term average for that specific day of the year. For example, the prediction for July 4th is the average of all temperatures ever recorded on July 4th in the training data. The `climatology_pred` function implements this by creating a lookup map from the training data and applying it to the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **2. Evaluating Baselines for Each Horizon**:\n",
    "    *   The code iterates through each forecast horizon (`t1`, `t3`, `t6`, `t12`, `t24`).\n",
    "    *   In each iteration, it calculates the RMSE for both the Persistence and Climatology models against the actual test data for that specific horizon.\n",
    "    *   The results are stored in a dictionary and printed. This output clearly shows that for short horizons (t1, t3), the **Persistence** model is much better, while for longer horizons (t12, t24), **Climatology** becomes the stronger baseline. This is an expected and intuitive result."

    "This section defines and executes a sophisticated, multi-stage feature selection pipeline. The goal is to systematically reduce the large number of engineered features (from 92) down to a smaller, more powerful, and diverse subset. This entire process is performed using **only the training data for the t+1 horizon** to create a single, unified set of features that will be used to train models for *all* horizons.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Step 1: Remove Temperature-Leaking Predictors**:\n",
    "    *   It begins by explicitly removing any features that are direct derivatives or proxies of the target temperature, such as `feelslike`. This is a crucial step to prevent data leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Step 2: Mutual Information (MI) Filtering**:\n",
    "    *   It calculates the Mutual Information score between each remaining feature and the `t+1` target variable.\n",
    "    *   Only the top 15% of features (with a minimum of 30) with the highest MI scores are kept. This acts as a first-pass filter to eliminate the least relevant features.\n",

    "*   **Step 3: Redundancy Pruning (Remove Highly Correlated Features)**:\n",
    "    *   A correlation matrix is created for the features that survived the MI filter.\n",
    "    *   The code then identifies and removes any feature that has a correlation greater than 0.92 with another feature. This step eliminates redundant information (multicollinearity).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Step 4: Lightweight XGBoost for Importance Ranking**:\n",

    "*   **Step 5: Family-Aware Selection**:\n",
    "    *   This is a custom logic designed to ensure feature diversity. It groups features by their \"family\" (prefix, e.g., 'humidity', 'dew', 'hour').\n",
    "    *   It then iterates through the most important families, selecting up to 4 of the top features from each, until a hard cap of 80 total features is reached.\n",
